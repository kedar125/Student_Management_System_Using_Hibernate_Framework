# Student_Management_System(Using Hibernate_Framework)
Designed Student Management System using Hibernate Framework, ORACLE database, and Swing for GUI. It provides the user to add or manipulate a studentâ€™s record in the database and the user can also visualize the data using JFreeCharts.
Worked on Java Application which interacts with ORACLE Database using Hibernate Framework.
